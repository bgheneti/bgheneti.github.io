I spent a half year in Freetown, Sierra Leone interning with the [Directorate of Science, Technology and Innovation](https://www.dsti.gov.sl/) (DSTI). During that time I worked with Glenna Wilson, Mohammed James (M.J.) and Maia Woluchem (another intern) as part of the GIS team. We designed and built a demo of the Integrated Geographic Information System (iGIS) Portal for the government of Sierra Leone (GoSL). The portal provides a one-stop-shop to government workers and the public for accessing and analyzing facilities and statistics related to Education, Health, Cell Towers, Law and other areas across 16 districts and 149 chiefdoms.

I'm really excited to continue watching the work DSTI and the people in it do in supporting GoSL and nurturing a tech ecosystem in Sierra Leone, and look forward to however our paths may cross going forward.
