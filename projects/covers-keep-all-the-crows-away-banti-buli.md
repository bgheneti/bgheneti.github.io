During the pandemic, I produced a couple covers under the moniker Banti Buli.

1. **Gold Day**
2. **Pure Cinema**
3. **Kerina**

### cover

1\.) _an object that that surrounds, lies on top of or otherwise shelters something to offer protection_  
2\.) _could include protection from elements, forces, eyes or any other things beyond the cover_  
3\.) _one function of these recordings_

These songs have lingered in and around my mind and room the past year or so. The originals are by artists whose music I really admire (Sparklehorse, Thao & The Get Down Stay Down, and Adrianne Lenker & Buck Meek).

The covers took many different shapes and I had different purposes arranging them (birthday, instrument free, sing low, tremolo, fortitude, fingerpicking). I hope they fit you well and, with any luck, assist you in keeping your crows away.

Thanks Chloe ([cjredmouth.bandcamp.com](https://cjredmouth.bandcamp.com)) for listening and sharing many ideas that mended and improved it all. Also, thanks for contributing some tapping noises to Pure Cinema.

Thanks Miske for lending me a trumpet for relearning and recording.
