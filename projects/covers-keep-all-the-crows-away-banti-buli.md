### Banti Buli

_One of my favorite musical experiences is listening to artists I enjoy_ [_covering_](https://weaves.bandcamp.com/track/drag-me-down-one-direction-cover) _or_ [_being covered_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtBK5oVUKTw) _by other artists. ~~Sometimes~~ Pretty often,_ [_I even enjoy a cover more than the original_](https://sldgmusc.bandcamp.com/track/pink-navel-graceland-paul-simon-coverr)_. As of now, I don't write my own songs, but I do enjoy playing, arranging and editing music, so I produced a couple covers under the moniker Banti Buli. It is pretty easy for me to try and brush aside a routine bedtime and, under the cover of night, chase one side project or other. In Afaan Oromoo, Banti Buli means "Banti, go to sleep" or "sleep on the peak," depending on how you look at it._

_I learned a bunch as a musician and engineer and felt overwhelmingly engaged in a mostly, but not always, healthy way. It is possible there will be more covers in the future. For now, here are some covers to keep all your crows away._

### what is a cover?

1\.) _an object that that surrounds, lies on top of or otherwise shelters something to offer protection_  
2\.) _could include protection from elements, forces, eyes or any other things beyond the cover_  
3\.) _one function of these recordings_

These covers have lingered in and around my mind and room for the past year or so. The originals are by artists whose music I really admire (Sparklehorse, Thao & The Get Down Stay Down, and Adrianne Lenker & Buck Meek).

These covers served me well. They took many different shapes as different purposes came up (birthdays, music with guitar, music without guitar, singing low, tremolo, fortitude, fingerpicking), but all in all they kept me immersed in an engaging space during the covid-19 pandemic. I hope they fit you well and, with any luck, assist you in keeping your crows away.

### what goes into a cover?

most instrumentals, vocals, arrangement - Banti  
lyrics, music - Mark Linkous (Gold Day), Thao Nguyen and Adam Thompson (Pure Cinema), Adrianne Lenker (Kerina)

Thanks Chloe ([cjredmouth.bandcamp.com](https://cjredmouth.bandcamp.com)) for listening and sharing many ideas that mended and improved it all. Also, thanks for contributing some tapping noises to Pure Cinema.

Thanks Miske for lending me a trumpet for relearning and recording.
