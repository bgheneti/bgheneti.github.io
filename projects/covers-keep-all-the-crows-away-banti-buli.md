During the pandemic, I produced a couple covers under the moniker Banti Buli.

### cover

1\.) an object that that surrounds, lies on top of or otherwise shelters something to offer protection  
2\.) could include protection from elements, forces, eyes or any other things beyond the cover  
3\.) one function of these recordings

These songs have lingered in and around my mind and room the past year or so. The originals are by artists whose music I really admire (Sparklehorse, Thao & The Get Down Stay Down, and Adrienne Lenker & Buck Meek).

The covers took many different shapes and I had different purposes arranging them (birthday, instrument free, sing low, tremolo, fortitude, fingerpicking). I hope they fit you well and, with any luck, assist you in keeping your crows away.
